            <h1>Our Platform</h1>
            <p>The Power Party believes in upholding the values that made this country great. Here are the core issues we stand for:</p>

            <div class="platform-details">
                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>National Defense</h2>
                    <p>We will ensure a strong national defense, modernizing our military to defend against both traditional and cyber threats. Our focus is on enhancing cyber defense and intelligence capabilities to protect the American people from terrorism and digital warfare.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Healthcare</h2>
                    <p>We support expanding ObamaCare to ensure that every American has access to affordable healthcare. Healthcare is a fundamental right, and we aim to reduce costs and improve outcomes through a more inclusive and efficient system.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>The Power Party prioritizes improving public schools and making them competitive with private education. Weâ€™ll increase funding and foster innovation to ensure that every child, regardless of their wealth, has access to a quality education.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Taxes</h2>
                    <p>Our tax policy aims for fairness. The wealthiest Americans will see a slight increase in taxes, with a maximum rate of 55%, in order to fund crucial services without stifling economic growth. We believe in a tax system that works for everyone.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Criminal Justice</h2>
                    <p>We advocate for stricter punishments for violent crimes while focusing on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. Our criminal justice system should work to give people a second chance while protecting our communities from harm.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Marriage & Family</h2>
                    <p>The Power Party believes that marriage should be between one man and one woman. We also support legislation that ensures schools do not promote or teach LGBTQ+ issues to children, respecting family values and parental rights.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Marijuana</h2>
                    <p>We believe in a federal ban on marijuana. Legalizing marijuana is harmful to public health, especially to young people, and we must take steps to protect the future of our youth from this growing epidemic.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h2>Abortion</h2>
                    <p>We believe that every unborn child deserves a chance at life. Abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. We stand for protecting the sanctity of life in all circumstances except the most extreme cases.</p>
